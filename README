Infinity Runtime Library
========================

Infinity is a platform-independent system for executables and shared
libraries to expose functionality to debug, monitoring, and analysis
tooling.  In Infinity, executable and shared library files contain
platform-independent Infinity functions in addition to their regular
contents.  libi8x allows programs to execute these functions.


Requirements
------------

libi8x is written in C and has no additional runtime dependencies
beyond the standard C library.  Some of its tests are written using
Python with the py3c compatibility layer and it’s recommended these
are installed at build time.  The libthread_db example uses libelf.


Installation
------------

libi8x is a regular autotools package and follows the usual process::

  ./configure
  make
  make check    # optional
  make install

To compile your own package against libi8x the use of pkg-config is
recommended.


Documentation
-------------

Right now there’s no documentation for libi8x aside from this
file.  This is being worked on!

work is planned and coordinated on https://infinitynotes.org/roadmap.
