These Python bindings are shipped with libi8x to run the Python tests
in libi8x's testsuite.  They're configured for static linking and, as
such:

  * They should not be installed system-wide.
  * They should not be used to build packages.

Versioned releases suitable for these purposes are available at
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/libi8x/>.
