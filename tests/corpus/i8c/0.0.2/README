All unique notes built by I8C 0.0.2's testsuite.

There are two variants:
  "be" notes were built on devel1.s390.bos.redhat.com:
    s390x
    Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 7.1 (Maipo)
    Python 2.7.5 (default, Feb 11 2014, 07:45:13)
    [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-13)] on linux2
    (from python-2.7.5-16.el7.s390x.rpm)
  "el" notes were built on my workstation:
    x86_64
    Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation release 6.6 (Santiago)
    Python 3.5.0 (default, Sep 24 2015, 10:17:43)
    [GCC 4.9.2 20150212 (Red Hat 4.9.2-6)] on linux
    (built from upstream source with DTS 3.1 GCC)

Both variants were built using contrib/libi8x-testnote-export.py
from commit 86e996b8bf2f61bd17d18099fbb84ff3a6a9a3a1, which is
actually I8C 0.0.2 plus a couple of commits, but nothing major.
